      <h3>The China Chronicles, Vol. I: What America can learn from an unknown Chinese city</h3>

      <h5>10-minute read</h5>

      <h6>19:01 ET, 12.27.18</h6>

      <p>

        I enjoyed the honor of spending four years in my life living in the Chinese province of Ningxia, working as and English teacher in the capital city of Yinchuan - a middle-sized city of 2 million people, an urban oasis rising out of the Gobi Desert, set along the banks of the winding Yellow River.
        <br><br>
      Nicknamed the Phoenix City, Yinchuan was at one point the capital of ancient China during the Xixia Dynasty, ruling from the 11th through the early 13th century.  An unknown place to most non-Chinese (I had never heard of the place before finding my job placement was there), Yinchuan has connections to some of history’s greatest figures.  It was the place of Ghengis Khan’s death in 1227, and was likely visited by Marco Polo during his travels along the Silk Road.
      <br><br>
      Though Han Chinese make up for over 90 percent of the country’s population, a third of Yinchuan’s people are Hui, one of China’s 56 officially recognized ethnic minorities, followers of Islam.    To my surprise, Yinchuan, along with the rest of Ningxia Province, along with much of Northwest China is dotted with mosques, Arabic script, and Muslim restaurants devoid of pork (which in other parts of China is the most commonly consumed meat).
      <br><br>
      Being an ignorant, sheltered American, I was under the impression that no religious practices were deemed legal under the Communist government.  A Muslim in China?  Before living there, I would have assumed such a person might be jailed or worse.  Quite the opposite.  Ningxia’s official name is the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.  In the uber-competitive written test for local government-associated positions, where often 3 out of 1,000 test-takers will obtain a job, people who are Hui are awarded extra points just for being Hui.  Keep in mind that in China, being a government employee, no matter the level, is seen as an ultimate position of respect and status.
      <br><br>
      Compare this truth as you turn to almost any American restaurant kitchen, where you find a majority of dish washers being Mexican immigrants, often being paid minimum wage or less.  When was the last time you saw a hotel maid who was not a female minority?  While the Great Wall of China is still a spectacular sight to visit, it is today nothing more than a tourist destination.  On December 11, the President of the United States tweeted about how “A Great Wall” would be the best solution for border security, and he was not talking about any tourist destination.  
      <br><br>
      What an irony it is that in 2018 so many still consider China to be a strict dictatorship, while proudly proclaiming America as “Land of the Free.”  Movies like Get Out, Black Panther, and more recently The Hate U Give, were critical and box office successes, but were made out of the necessity to tell America a very simple message, that has been trying to be conveyed for hundreds of years: we deserve to be treated as equals.
      <br><br>
      Crazy Rich Asians was arguably the hit of the summer, being praised for its plot, direction, and acting, but also for being the first mainstream American-made film to star an all Asian cast.  It is great that such a movie was made, but why did it take until 2018 for this to happen?  And when it did, did it need to be such a big deal that it was an all-Asian movie?
      <br><br>
      Less of a hit, but even more of a poignant story than Crazy Rich Asians was Wind River, telling the bitter, violent story of the assault and murder of an 18-year-old Native American woman.  This film caught me completely off guard.  I, as most Americans, am aware that there are problems in our country regarding acceptance and equality issues with blacks, Latinos, and Asians.  My limited “ignorance is bliss” brain rarely focuses on the fact that the people who occupied this land for thousands of years before it became “America” are to this day mostly relegated to Indian reservations, and, as the closing title card of Wind River reads, “Missing-persons statistics are kept for every demographic group except for Native American women, whose numbers remain unknown.”
      <br><br>
      One of the current front-runners for Best Picture at this year’s upcoming Academy Awards is Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma.  I will say that it is an accomplishment that a foreign-language film focused on the political turmoil in 1970s Mexico can be in the discussion for best picture.  One must wonder however, would Alfonso Cuaron’s film be held in such high regard had he not first directed films targeted towards a completely Euro-American audience (2006’s Children of Men, 2013’s Gravity, and a Harry Potter film)?
      <br><br>
      All this is to say that in China, there are no films about the struggles of the Hui against the oppressive Han majority government.  Why?  Because there is no motherfucking need for it.  Hui and Han simply coexist in Yinchuan.  Hui restaurants are filled with Han customers.  My wife is Han Chinese.  One of her best friends, a Han Chinese man, recently married a Hui woman.  No one batted an eye.  The man has agreed to adapt her family’s Muslim practices.  He doesn’t see it as a big deal.  No one in Yinchuan sees a Hui person and thinks him any more likely to be carrying a bomb or being a radical.  My wife told me that sometimes a Han guy will slip a piece of pork into a Hui guy’s dish.  Instead of tweaking out and reprimanding the Han guy, everyone has a good-natured laugh about it.  Point being: in Yinchuan, it’s all good.
      <br><br>
      I went to China through an opportunity with the Lutheran Church.  During the day I worked at a high school teaching English, while I would spend many of my nights and weekends leading Bible studies for those who were interested.  I never forced a Chinese - Han, Hui, or otherwise - to attend.  Those who were interested came.  I had a number of Hui people attend.  They listened, we discussed, and we were respectful to one another.
      <br><br>
      One of the many friends I met while in China was a college student named Sophia.  She was a devout Hui, fasting during Ramadan, being able to read the Quran in its original Arabic.  She came to several Bible studies.  During my summer vacation I travelled to her hometown and she showed me her place of worship.  I gave her an English-Chinese Bible.  She educated me on the beliefs of Islam.  We learned from each other, and we both benefited from the friendship.
      <br><br>
      I don’t want to give the impression that everything is all rainbows and unicorns as far as China and its minority groups.  Both the native people of Tibet and the Uygher people of China’s Xinjiang Province have qualms about the way they are treated by the government, and many yearn to break away from China.  Like all countries, China is far from perfect.  I write merely to speak from my perspective about the city and place where I spent the most valuable and eye-opening time of my life.  And through that lens, I deem “The People’s Republic of China” to be a more apt and accurate title than the United States, “Land of the Free.”
