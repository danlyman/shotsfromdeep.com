    <h3>The Current Plight of Jim Boylen's Bulls</h3>

      <h5>6-minute read</h5>

      <h6>00:12 ET, 12.20.18</h6>

      <p>

      “We’ll be right back with a final word from the United Center.. after this timeout …”  71-year-old Chicago Bull play-by-play man Neil Funk’s voice aimlessly cascades into the abyss as a shroud of silence hovers over the arena.  Certainly the vast majority of the 18,000 fans who came out on a Tuesday night to watch their seven-win team take on the Brooklyn Nets - hours after the news that leading scorer Zach LaVine would be out 2-4 weeks with an ankle sprain - remained in the stands until the final buzzer.  
      <br><br>
      The despondency of supporter and announcer alike echoed full as the broadcast cut to commercial.  Just as happens with teams that have hit rock bottom - regardless of sport - the Bulls on this night found a way to lose.  Don’t get this confused with Chicago’s infamous early season losses to the Warriors, where Klay Thompson drained a league-record 14 treys, or to the 56-point trouncing by the Celtics.  Needless to say on these nights, the temperament of the team had doomed them before tip-off.  Not so tonight.
      <br><br>
      Funk’s broadcast partner Stacey King accurately noted that the loss tonight was not due to a lack of effort.  The young rotation of Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, and Wendell Carter Jr. among others put forth and inspired team performance throughout, holding an up-and-coming squad from Brooklyn below the century mark (this is the third time in four games the defense has achieved this, after accomplishing the feat a mere four times over their first 28 contests).
      <br><br>
      Perhaps (perhaps) coach Jim Boylen’s Thibodeau-like tactics are beginning to resonate among the roster a week and a half removed from the team’s near-insubordination of a practice the day after a back-to-back, the latter of which being the aforementioned Celtics debacle.  Though the Bulls have shown a defensive effort blatantly lacking earlier in the year, this cannot will shots to fall in the final minutes, nor can it even make for one teammate transferring the ball to another a sure thing.
      <br><br>
      Down one with the ball and the momentum, coming off a defensive forced shot clot violation and a full time out with 8.4 seconds left, Justin Holiday (in a role that likely would have been given to LaVine, if healthy) dances around the top of the key, not sure if he should shoot or pass, sees the clock tick below five seconds.  He sees Kris Dunn run towards him and hesitantly looks to hand off the ball into Dunn’s bread basket.  
      <br><br>
      The clumsiness of the almost-exchanged reaps consequences, as Spencer Dinwiddie - who he himself danced around until the shot clock went empty on the last possession - makes up for his indecision by grabbing away the ball from the two guards.  Boylen, stationary in bewilderment for a moment, claps his hands and encourage his players that the game is not over.  “Well, I am seeing effort,” he must console himself with. Out of the time out Bobby Portis saunters back onto the court, head shaking - unimpressed with coach’s message on the bench.  Free throws made, a last second heave down court, game over.
      <br><br>
      The Bulls would do well to look at the team they lost to and see themselves reflected.  Currently on pace for 18 wins this season, it was two seasons ago that the Nets finished 20-62, with young pups Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and Caris LaVert cutting their teeth in the NBA.  While still far from a threat in the East, Brooklyn now has that “hot young team” moniker attached to its aura.  
      <br><br>
      It was during that ‘16-’17 season that Kenny Atkinson took over the head coaching position.  Even with the 20-win season, Atkinson had almost universal approval from both the team and the media.  Not so with Boylen, a long-time NBA assistant and head coach at the University of Utah from 2007-’11.  After an appearance in the Big Dance in ‘09, his teams finished below .500 in his final two seasons at the then-Mountain West program before his firing.
      <br><br>
      After being Fred Hoiberg’s top assistant since his arrival in 2015, Boylen was name head coach on December 3rd, inheriting the 5-19 club without an interim tag.  After two weeks on the job with a last-place team, it is too early to pass judgment on Boylen and his demanding coaching style.  
      True are the following: the Bulls have young talent and cap space in the third largest market in the country.  But as for tonight, the team, and their coach, seem that they will be giving Neil Funk and their loyal fans many more desolate winter nights before the warmth of a winning franchise returns to the Windy City.
