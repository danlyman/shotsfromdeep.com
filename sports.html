     <h3>The Most Dominant and Exciting Athlete in Sports is The Lioness</h3>

      <h5>10-minute read</h5>

      <h6>11:21 ET, 12.30.18</h6>

      <p>

        There is no more exhilarating wave of pure adrenaline in sports than an MMA match where both fighters swing for the fences with reckless abandon.  A last-second game-winning 3, a Hail Mary, or a walk-off home run may have more euphoria packed into the moment, but that is exactly what they are: moments.  Much of the energy in the stadium or in the announcer’s TV call brims with anticipation - potential energy as we wait for the kinetic.  When Amanda Nunes is in the octagon, it’s all kinetic.
        <br><br>
      The 30-year-old Brazilian fighter was a +195 underdog coming into her bout with Cris Cyborg, not too far from her +145 line when she faced Rhonda Rousey at UFC 207.  Reflecting these odds was an alike storyline during the buildup for each bout: Nunes was an aggressive and powerful fighter, but she was going up against the greatest to ever do it.
      <br><br>
      For Rousey, the fight with Nunes was supposed to mark the apex of her comeback after her unthinkable first career loss to Holly Holm at UFC 193.  In the year following the defeat Rousey took time off, hosted Saturday Night Live, went on Ellen and admitted to depression, and then began her journey back to reclaiming her title as the greatest female fighter in MMA history.  Her opponent became an afterthought to the journey Rousey had been on to get back in the cage.  Joan Jett’s “Bad Reputation” blared through T-Mobile Arena as Rowdy Ronda strode in, a fighter determined to reclaim her championship belt.  And then the fight happened.
      <br><br>
      The tables were turned on Rousey fights of old, when she would tee off on opponents, knocking them out with punches or submitting them with the armbar, seconds into the first round.  As many pre-fight might have guessed, it was all over in under a minute.  But on this night Rousey was the one being teed off upon.  The Lioness “lit Ronda up like a Christmas tree” as Joe Rogan put it as Rousey stood dazed, cut, and bruised after the fight was called 48 seconds in.  Already the champion of the women’s bantamweight division, on that night Amanda Nunes showed the world that her belt would not be taken anytime soon.
      <br><br>
      Nunes’ dominance in that fight effectively ended Rousey’s career in mixed martial arts.  It is hard to believe that two years to the day have passed since Ronda officially disappeared as the face of the UFC.  After one last $3 million paycheck (Nunes made $300,000 as the winner) Ronda Rousey exited the octagon for what we must believe is the last time.  This is not to say that Rousey has disappeared from the public eye.  In a move that made sense for all involved, Ronda signed a contract with the WWE in 2017 and has since become the women’s champion in her new profession.  Just don’t forget who brought upon the career change.
      <br><br>
      Since her defeat of Rousey, Nunes defended her bantamweight belt against Valentina Shevchenko, in arguably her toughest match since then, winning in a split decision.  At UFC 224 against Raquel Pennington, the fight again made it to the 5th round, but there was no doubt it this one.  When the referee called a stop to this one, Pennington was a bloody mess and Nunes reigned dominant.
      <br><br>
      What was next for The Lioness?  She chose to follow in the footsteps of Conor McGregor and Daniel Cormier in the pursuit becoming the third fighter in MMA history to hold championship belts in two divisions simultaneously.  Standing in the way: Cyborg.  A fellow Brazilian, Cris Cyborg became the most vaunted name is women’s MMA since Rousey’s reign ended, despite Nunes’ undeniable success.
      <br><br>
      Since losing her first professional fight, Cyborg had not lost since, spanning a time frame of 15 years.  Save for one fight (against Holm), Cyborg’s opponents have never made it to the end of the fight.  After winning the inaugural women’s featherweight championship in early 2017, Dutch fighter Germaine de Randamie, was stripped of her title, not for any banned substances or legal problems, but for her refusal to defend her belt against Cyborg.  De Randamie sighted Cyborg’s history with steroid use as the reason for her denial of the fight.  It is true that Cyborg tested positive for the banned substance stanozolol.  However, this was seven years ago.  As a result, de Randamie was stripped of her title over her unwillingness to take on the legendary opponent.  Cyborg went on to win the vacated featherweight title and defended it twice.
      <br><br>
      Which brings us back to last night.  Champion vs. Champion.  Again, Nunes came in as the underdog.  Again, her name and her reputation paled in comparison to her opponent.  Again, she would make less money in the fight ($350,000 compared to Cyborg’s half million).  And again, the result was the same.  Granted, the fight did last longer than her defeat of Rousey … three seconds longer.
      <br><br>
      Watching Amanda Nunes in her fights against Rousey and Cyborg is like watching a tropical storm morph into a category five hurricane in a matter or seconds.  Both Rousey and Cyborg landed a few punches in desperation mode, but it looked as if the Lioness literally did not notice their existence.  Unlike football or basketball, fighting has no drawn up plays.  Strategy and technique, of course.  But for five minute stretches, it is fighter versus fighter.  When Nunes starts going off on you, there is no telling if the opponent will weather the storm or if the ref will have to mercifully put a stop to the bludgeoning proceedings at his best judgment.  A walk-off has to happen in the bottom of the ninth or later, usually three or more hours since the start of the contest.  With Nunes, you don’t know when the end is coming.  With Pennington, it was later.  With Rousey and then Cyborg, it was much sooner.
      <br><br>
      Which brings us to the final point on Nunes’ multi-title-holding dominance: the bigger the name of her opponent, the brighter the lights, and the higher the pay-per-view buys, the more violent all that kinetic energy becomes - a violence with spot-on precision.  As UFC fighter/analyst Dominick Cruz noted after the fight, Nunes’ punches rarely miss.  They are more so than not, on the button.  After a barrage of shots, the Lioness hit her walk-off in the form of a right hook to the temple of Cyborg, tumbling her face-first to the mat.
      <br><br>
      The joy of Nunes post-fight makes her a lovable champion.  After literally picking her opponent up off the mat, Nunes herself laid down and cried tears of the ultimate accomplishment: taking down the two biggest names in women’s MMA history.  When she thanks her fans, her coach, who she says acts as a father to her as well, and her partner, fellow fighter Nina Ansaroff, she does so with a joy and a humility matched by few others in the sport.
      <br><br>
      Despite the return of Jon Jones and his defeat of Alexander Gustafsson to close out UFC 232, and his subsequent re-calling out of Daniel Cormier, Amanda Nunes looks to be the most likeable, dominant, and accomplished fighter in UFC as of today.  ESPN should thank Nunes for her performance as the calendar turns to 2019 and their TV deal with the UFC begins.  The question is, who is left for Nunes to take down?  Immediately there were calls for a rematch with Cyborg.  As far as a big name and the number of eyeballs watching, this does seem to make the most sense.  But after such a beat down, can we say that Cyborg is deserving of getting Nunes again in her next fight?
      <br><br>
      Questions will swirl about who can even give Amanda Nunes a run for one of her two belts.  Whoever it is must come in with a plan to somehow stop the attacks of a true Lioness, and a truly great champion.

     <h3>The Unique Euphoria of College Athletics</h3>

      <h5>5-minute read</h5>

      <h6>01:17 ET, 12.23.18</h6>

        It was a crisp October evening in 2011.  I was a member of the University of Wisconsin Marching Band, and it was game day on campus.  The undefeated Ohio State Buckeyes entered Camp Randall ranked as the No. 1 team in the country.  An early evening kickoff, the sun fell in the sky as a crowd of 81,194 went from raucous to clinically insane as David Gilreath took the opening kickoff end zone to end zone for the Badgers, who went up and never looked back.  
        <br><br>
      The memory is glorious.  Of course, as Badger football goes, the season ended in heartbreak with a loss to Andy Dalton’s TCU squad in the Rose Bowl.  But as Wisconsin fans at Camp Randall, on that October night, we will carry that joy to the grave.
      <br><br>
      I write of this memory after watching the No. 1 college basketball team in the country, Kansas, fall to the Sun Devils of Arizona State.  Just like the Buckeye football team, the Jayhawks entered this content with an undefeated record.  And just like the Badgers, ASU was ranked No. 18, the team and its fans were exhilarated to take down the top team in the land.
      <br><br>
      The way in which they achieved the victory was quite different.  The Devils spent the first 38 minutes of the game trailing, at times by double digits.  When Rob Edwards nailed a 3 to put ASU in front for the first time, 76-74 with 2:20 left in the game, the arena took on the same insane atmosphere experience in Camp Randall, and in countless other collegiate contests over the decades.  Once up, you had the feeling they would not let go.
      <br><br>
      Sophomore six-foot guard Remy Martin dropped two contested step-back jumpers in the final minute to seal the victory.  It is in these game situations where we see the pure euphoria of college athletics.  On the bench, every teammate locked arms.  Coming out of a time out, before their final defensive stand, the Sun Devil five huddled alone on the court, vowing to not let the opportunity slip.
      <br><br>
      When the buzzer sounded, a mass of yellow and maroon rushed the court, mixed in with a Santa suit or two.  Cheerleaders abandoned any organized, practiced routine, and jumped in elation with the rest of student body.  Bill Walton proclaimed the greatness of the game and of college basketball.  Though continually marred by scandal of player compensation, tonight was about the game.  Tonight was pure.
      <br><br>
      Where David Gilreath is now, I could not tell you.  After a stint with the New Orleans Saints, he surely is no longer in the NFL.  How many of the Sun Devils are projected to have NBA futures?  One for certain (freshman Luguentz Dort), maybe a second.  In spectacles such as these, this matters not.
      <br><br>
      Finally we see coach Bobby Hurley going over to his wife, and they embrace.  This is still a regular season game, mind you.  When a team beats Golden State a third of the way through the season, you do not see the coach’s family holding back tears of happiness.  The team, the school, the commitment, and the payoff.  It is cycle that can run in October, in December, or most famously in March.  And it is why, no matter the shroud of scandal and the debate of a college athlete’s rights, the game will still reign supreme.  And when it does, nothing quite compares.

    <h3>The Current Plight of Jim Boylen's Bulls</h3>

      <h5>6-minute read</h5>

      <h6>00:12 ET, 12.20.18</h6>

      <p>

      “We’ll be right back with a final word from the United Center.. after this timeout …”  71-year-old Chicago Bull play-by-play man Neil Funk’s voice aimlessly cascades into the abyss as a shroud of silence hovers over the arena.  Certainly the vast majority of the 18,000 fans who came out on a Tuesday night to watch their seven-win team take on the Brooklyn Nets - hours after the news that leading scorer Zach LaVine would be out 2-4 weeks with an ankle sprain - remained in the stands until the final buzzer.  
      <br><br>
      The despondency of supporter and announcer alike echoed full as the broadcast cut to commercial.  Just as happens with teams that have hit rock bottom - regardless of sport - the Bulls on this night found a way to lose.  Don’t get this confused with Chicago’s infamous early season losses to the Warriors, where Klay Thompson drained a league-record 14 treys, or to the 56-point trouncing by the Celtics.  Needless to say on these nights, the temperament of the team had doomed them before tip-off.  Not so tonight.
      <br><br>
      Funk’s broadcast partner Stacey King accurately noted that the loss tonight was not due to a lack of effort.  The young rotation of Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, and Wendell Carter Jr. among others put forth and inspired team performance throughout, holding an up-and-coming squad from Brooklyn below the century mark (this is the third time in four games the defense has achieved this, after accomplishing the feat a mere four times over their first 28 contests).
      <br><br>
      Perhaps (perhaps) coach Jim Boylen’s Thibodeau-like tactics are beginning to resonate among the roster a week and a half removed from the team’s near-insubordination of a practice the day after a back-to-back, the latter of which being the aforementioned Celtics debacle.  Though the Bulls have shown a defensive effort blatantly lacking earlier in the year, this cannot will shots to fall in the final minutes, nor can it even make for one teammate transferring the ball to another a sure thing.
      <br><br>
      Down one with the ball and the momentum, coming off a defensive forced shot clot violation and a full time out with 8.4 seconds left, Justin Holiday (in a role that likely would have been given to LaVine, if healthy) dances around the top of the key, not sure if he should shoot or pass, sees the clock tick below five seconds.  He sees Kris Dunn run towards him and hesitantly looks to hand off the ball into Dunn’s bread basket.  
      <br><br>
      The clumsiness of the almost-exchanged reaps consequences, as Spencer Dinwiddie - who he himself danced around until the shot clock went empty on the last possession - makes up for his indecision by grabbing away the ball from the two guards.  Boylen, stationary in bewilderment for a moment, claps his hands and encourage his players that the game is not over.  “Well, I am seeing effort,” he must console himself with. Out of the time out Bobby Portis saunters back onto the court, head shaking - unimpressed with coach’s message on the bench.  Free throws made, a last second heave down court, game over.
      <br><br>
      The Bulls would do well to look at the team they lost to and see themselves reflected.  Currently on pace for 18 wins this season, it was two seasons ago that the Nets finished 20-62, with young pups Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and Caris LaVert cutting their teeth in the NBA.  While still far from a threat in the East, Brooklyn now has that “hot young team” moniker attached to its aura.  
      <br><br>
      It was during that ‘16-’17 season that Kenny Atkinson took over the head coaching position.  Even with the 20-win season, Atkinson had almost universal approval from both the team and the media.  Not so with Boylen, a long-time NBA assistant and head coach at the University of Utah from 2007-’11.  After an appearance in the Big Dance in ‘09, his teams finished below .500 in his final two seasons at the then-Mountain West program before his firing.
      <br><br>
      After being Fred Hoiberg’s top assistant since his arrival in 2015, Boylen was name head coach on December 3rd, inheriting the 5-19 club without an interim tag.  After two weeks on the job with a last-place team, it is too early to pass judgment on Boylen and his demanding coaching style.  
      True are the following: the Bulls have young talent and cap space in the third largest market in the country.  But as for tonight, the team, and their coach, seem that they will be giving Neil Funk and their loyal fans many more desolate winter nights before the warmth of a winning franchise returns to the Windy City.
