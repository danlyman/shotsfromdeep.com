        Daniel grew up in a small Wisconsin town, graduated from the University of Wisconsin majoring in Journalism/Strategic Communications and Art History, and jetted off to China.  There, he taught English to the children of low-income families at Ningxia Province’s Liu Pan Shan High School.  
        <br><br>
        It was in China that he found Hanlu - a smart and beautiful girl, in love with Disney movies and ice cream.  Daniel returned to the Midwest with the Hanlu, who obtained a Master’s degree from Michigan State University in three semesters.  They were married in 2017 and moved to Charlotte, NC with their tabby cat Vivian, where Hanlu began work as a UX designer.  
        <br><br>
        Daniel worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant while taking classes in Web Development at TechTalent South.  He now uses HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Ruby on Rails to build websites and apps.  After keeping a daily journal during his five years in China, Daniel has brought his passion for writing online, through his blog “Shots From Deep,” which he also designed and coded.  
        <br><br>
        He looks forward to coding, writing, and one day, returning with Hanlu to their homeland of China.
