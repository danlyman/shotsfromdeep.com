	    <h3>The China Chronicles, Vol. I: What America can learn from an unknown Chinese city</h3>

	    <h5>10-minute read</h5>

	    <h6>19:01 ET, 12.27.18</h6>

	    <p>

	    	I enjoyed the honor of spending four years in my life living in the Chinese province of Ningxia, working as and English teacher in the capital city of Yinchuan - a middle-sized city of 2 million people, an urban oasis rising out of the Gobi Desert, set along the banks of the winding Yellow River.
	    	<br><br>
			Nicknamed the Phoenix City, Yinchuan was at one point the capital of ancient China during the Xixia Dynasty, ruling from the 11th through the early 13th century.  An unknown place to most non-Chinese (I had never heard of the place before finding my job placement was there), Yinchuan has connections to some of history’s greatest figures.  It was the place of Ghengis Khan’s death in 1227, and was likely visited by Marco Polo during his travels along the Silk Road.
			<br><br>
			Though Han Chinese make up for over 90 percent of the country’s population, a third of Yinchuan’s people are Hui, one of China’s 56 officially recognized ethnic minorities, followers of Islam.    To my surprise, Yinchuan, along with the rest of Ningxia Province, along with much of Northwest China is dotted with mosques, Arabic script, and Muslim restaurants devoid of pork (which in other parts of China is the most commonly consumed meat).
			<br><br>
			Being an ignorant, sheltered American, I was under the impression that no religious practices were deemed legal under the Communist government.  A Muslim in China?  Before living there, I would have assumed such a person might be jailed or worse.  Quite the opposite.  Ningxia’s official name is the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region.  In the uber-competitive written test for local government-associated positions, where often 3 out of 1,000 test-takers will obtain a job, people who are Hui are awarded extra points just for being Hui.  Keep in mind that in China, being a government employee, no matter the level, is seen as an ultimate position of respect and status.
			<br><br>
			Compare this truth as you turn to almost any American restaurant kitchen, where you find a majority of dish washers being Mexican immigrants, often being paid minimum wage or less.  When was the last time you saw a hotel maid who was not a female minority?  While the Great Wall of China is still a spectacular sight to visit, it is today nothing more than a tourist destination.  On December 11, the President of the United States tweeted about how “A Great Wall” would be the best solution for border security, and he was not talking about any tourist destination.  
			<br><br>
			What an irony it is that in 2018 so many still consider China to be a strict dictatorship, while proudly proclaiming America as “Land of the Free.”  Movies like Get Out, Black Panther, and more recently The Hate U Give, were critical and box office successes, but were made out of the necessity to tell America a very simple message, that has been trying to be conveyed for hundreds of years: we deserve to be treated as equals.
			<br><br>
			Crazy Rich Asians was arguably the hit of the summer, being praised for its plot, direction, and acting, but also for being the first mainstream American-made film to star an all Asian cast.  It is great that such a movie was made, but why did it take until 2018 for this to happen?  And when it did, did it need to be such a big deal that it was an all-Asian movie?
			<br><br>
			Less of a hit, but even more of a poignant story than Crazy Rich Asians was Wind River, telling the bitter, violent story of the assault and murder of an 18-year-old Native American woman.  This film caught me completely off guard.  I, as most Americans, am aware that there are problems in our country regarding acceptance and equality issues with blacks, Latinos, and Asians.  My limited “ignorance is bliss” brain rarely focuses on the fact that the people who occupied this land for thousands of years before it became “America” are to this day mostly relegated to Indian reservations, and, as the closing title card of Wind River reads, “Missing-persons statistics are kept for every demographic group except for Native American women, whose numbers remain unknown.”
			<br><br>
			One of the current front-runners for Best Picture at this year’s upcoming Academy Awards is Alfonso Cuaron’s Roma.  I will say that it is an accomplishment that a foreign-language film focused on the political turmoil in 1970s Mexico can be in the discussion for best picture.  One must wonder however, would Alfonso Cuaron’s film be held in such high regard had he not first directed films targeted towards a completely Euro-American audience (2006’s Children of Men, 2013’s Gravity, and a Harry Potter film)?
			<br><br>
			All this is to say that in China, there are no films about the struggles of the Hui against the oppressive Han majority government.  Why?  Because there is no motherfucking need for it.  Hui and Han simply coexist in Yinchuan.  Hui restaurants are filled with Han customers.  My wife is Han Chinese.  One of her best friends, a Han Chinese man, recently married a Hui woman.  No one batted an eye.  The man has agreed to adapt her family’s Muslim practices.  He doesn’t see it as a big deal.  No one in Yinchuan sees a Hui person and thinks him any more likely to be carrying a bomb or being a radical.  My wife told me that sometimes a Han guy will slip a piece of pork into a Hui guy’s dish.  Instead of tweaking out and reprimanding the Han guy, everyone has a good-natured laugh about it.  Point being: in Yinchuan, it’s all good.
			<br><br>
			I went to China through an opportunity with the Lutheran Church.  During the day I worked at a high school teaching English, while I would spend many of my nights and weekends leading Bible studies for those who were interested.  I never forced a Chinese - Han, Hui, or otherwise - to attend.  Those who were interested came.  I had a number of Hui people attend.  They listened, we discussed, and we were respectful to one another.
			<br><br>
			One of the many friends I met while in China was a college student named Sophia.  She was a devout Hui, fasting during Ramadan, being able to read the Quran in its original Arabic.  She came to several Bible studies.  During my summer vacation I travelled to her hometown and she showed me her place of worship.  I gave her an English-Chinese Bible.  She educated me on the beliefs of Islam.  We learned from each other, and we both benefited from the friendship.
			<br><br>
			I don’t want to give the impression that everything is all rainbows and unicorns as far as China and its minority groups.  Both the native people of Tibet and the Uygher people of China’s Xinjiang Province have qualms about the way they are treated by the government, and many yearn to break away from China.  Like all countries, China is far from perfect.  I write merely to speak from my perspective about the city and place where I spent the most valuable and eye-opening time of my life.  And through that lens, I deem “The People’s Republic of China” to be a more apt and accurate title than the United States, “Land of the Free.”

	    <h3>The Unique Euphoria of College Athletics</h3>

	    <h5>5-minute read</h5>

	    	It was a crisp October evening in 2011.  I was a member of the University of Wisconsin Marching Band, and it was game day on campus.  The undefeated Ohio State Buckeyes entered Camp Randall ranked as the No. 1 team in the country.  An early evening kickoff, the sun fell in the sky as a crowd of 81,194 went from raucous to clinically insane as David Gilreath took the opening kickoff end zone to end zone for the Badgers, who went up and never looked back.  
	    	<br><br>
			The memory is glorious.  Of course, as Badger football goes, the season ended in heartbreak with a loss to Andy Dalton’s TCU squad in the Rose Bowl.  But as Wisconsin fans at Camp Randall, on that October night, we will carry that joy to the grave.
			<br><br>
			I write of this memory after watching the No. 1 college basketball team in the country, Kansas, fall to the Sun Devils of Arizona State.  Just like the Buckeye football team, the Jayhawks entered this content with an undefeated record.  And just like the Badgers, ASU was ranked No. 18, the team and its fans were exhilarated to take down the top team in the land.
			<br><br>
			The way in which they achieved the victory was quite different.  The Devils spent the first 38 minutes of the game trailing, at times by double digits.  When Rob Edwards nailed a 3 to put ASU in front for the first time, 76-74 with 2:20 left in the game, the arena took on the same insane atmosphere experience in Camp Randall, and in countless other collegiate contests over the decades.  Once up, you had the feeling they would not let go.
			<br><br>
			Sophomore six-foot guard Remy Martin dropped two contested step-back jumpers in the final minute to seal the victory.  It is in these game situations where we see the pure euphoria of college athletics.  On the bench, every teammate locked arms.  Coming out of a time out, before their final defensive stand, the Sun Devil five huddled alone on the court, vowing to not let the opportunity slip.
			<br><br>
			When the buzzer sounded, a mass of yellow and maroon rushed the court, mixed in with a Santa suit or two.  Cheerleaders abandoned any organized, practiced routine, and jumped in elation with the rest of student body.  Bill Walton proclaimed the greatness of the game and of college basketball.  Though continually marred by scandal of player compensation, tonight was about the game.  Tonight was pure.
			<br><br>
			Where David Gilreath is now, I could not tell you.  After a stint with the New Orleans Saints, he surely is no longer in the NFL.  How many of the Sun Devils are projected to have NBA futures?  One for certain (freshman Luguentz Dort), maybe a second.  In spectacles such as these, this matters not.
			<br><br>
			Finally we see coach Bobby Hurley going over to his wife, and they embrace.  This is still a regular season game, mind you.  When a team beats Golden State a third of the way through the season, you do not see the coach’s family holding back tears of happiness.  The team, the school, the commitment, and the payoff.  It is cycle that can run in October, in December, or most famously in March.  And it is why, no matter the shroud of scandal and the debate of a college athlete’s rights, the game will still reign supreme.  And when it does, nothing quite compares.

	    <h3>Something is off in <i>Marwen</i></h3>

	    <h5>11-minute read</h5>

	    <h6>14:13 ET, 12.21.18</h6>

	    <p>
	      
	      Unless a movie was particularly spectacular, after leaving a cinema usually my wife and I don’t discuss our thoughts on the movie we have just seen.  We will go out for dinner and discuss other parts of real life.  By the end of the evening, when our mental digestion of the film has begun to sink in, one of us will go back and comment on the film.  “There was something missing,” my wife said last night, simultaneously naturally and out of the blue.  She needn’t give context.
	      <br><br>
		The film <i>Welcome to Marwen</i> tells the real-life story of Mark Hogancamp, an artist who in April of 2000 was mercilessly beaten nearly to death by a group of five assailants outside of a bar after stating that he enjoyed wearing women’s shoes.  After coming out of a coma and suffering almost complete memory loss, Hogancamp deals with his PTSD by building a miniature town populated by a doll version of himself as a soldier for the Allied forces in World War II, along with the people he has come in contact with, including his attackers depicted in the form of Nazi soldiers.
		<br><br>
		It would be hard to blame Steve Carell for taking the part in Robert Zemeckis’ newest release, arriving alongside <i>Aquaman</i> and <i>Mary Poppins Returns</i>, all vying for holiday box office crowds.  Zemeckis has had a knack for finding a leading man and either jump-starting his career (as he did with Michael J. fox in the <i>Back to the Future</i> franchise), or further cementing him as an A+ list star (Tom Hanks in <i>Forrest Gump</i> and <i>Castaway</i>, Denzel Washington in <i>Flight</i>).  A big-name director, a moving true-life story of pain and perseverance, set for a Christmas release date.  The building blocks were there for Carrel to front the next successful installment of the Zemeckis canon.
		<br><br>
		As he has in films prior, Carell gives a performance to evidence that he is more than a master of comedy, possessing the chops to embody real-life figures struggling with various incarnations of darkness.  In 2014 his portrayal of wealthy, troubled Olympic wrestling sponsor John du Pont in Bennett Miller’s <i>Foxcatcher</i> earned him his first Oscar nomination.  His more recent performance as New York Times journalist David Sheff, dealing with a son (Timothee Chalamet) addicted to mathaphetamines garnered Carell, along with Chalamet, further critical acclaim in Felix van Groeningen’s <i>Beautiful Boy</i>.
		<br><br>
		In one of the several, semi-climactic apexes of <i>Marwen</i>, Carell’s eyes well up and spill over with tears as he realizes that to continue on with his life, he must face his real-life attackers.  I find crying scenes to be a good measure of an actor’s genuine abilities.  With some, you hear the voice break, see the face contort, but nary a tear falls.  With others, one or two will squeeze out as you see the actor behind the character grinding the mental wheels for the payoff.  Carell’s tears in this scene, were above all else, natural.  Have no doubt, this comedian is also a capital “A” actor.  Or to correct myself, he is an actor, who within his skill set happens to be an extraordinary comic.
		<br><br>
		Yet the environment, pacing, and overall writing of this movie simply seem off from beginning to end.  The technical achievement of filming nearly half the film in stop-motion animation, depicting Mark’s story being played out through the plastic eyes of Marwen’s dolls, is in and of itself visually striking.  Disappointingly for the actresses who surround and support Carell in the film, they are almost exclusively seen in their animated forms, acting literal props to help “Captain Hoagie” conquer his fears.
		<br><br>
		Many of these women also seem to be depicted as rigid figures of stereotypes.  Carell’s caregiver appears in all of one scene in her real-live human form, using a stunningly over-the-top Russian accent that was seemingly meant to be entertaining, but came off as simply unnecessary.  Another exhibit of this is Caralala, the Latina cook at the bar where Mark works (the same bar where he was beaten).  This bar is clearly not associated with any Latino themes, but in all of the two-and-a-half scenes in which Caralala appears, she wears traditional Latino blouses and skirts, so out of place as she and Mark prepare meatballs in a dingy upstate New York kitchen.  I won’t even go into explaining the French adult film actress who was somehow a necessary tertiary character and is portrayed by Zemeckis’ wife in real life.  In their doll forms, the woman are even more flamboyantly dressed in such outfits.  This is perhaps going for the “World Culture Barbie” feel, but the whole display simply left me thinking “Huh??”
		<br><br>
		The figure of Carell’s romantic interest is played by Leslie Mann, the seasoned veteran from a number of comedy films, many of which directed by her husband, Judd Apatow.  Mann also shows her talents as a sympathetic and caring figure, and her character, Nicol (“without the ‘e’”), admittedly does in many scenes where she is not an animated doll.  However, Zemeckis is intent on making her look as close to a doll as possible in these real-life scenes.  Her character has vivid red hair, wears brightly-colored dresses with flowery straps, loves having tea parties, and is occasionally stalked by a vaguely biker gang-like asshole of an ex-boyfriend.  I half expected Deadpool to drop in and cut this guy in half with his katanas and drop a one-liner.  Carell’s character also notices in one seen that Nicol at one time had a young son who had passed away.  This is never referenced again in the movie, almost echoing the scene from <i>The Room</i> where Lisa’s mother casually mentions that she has cancer as a one-line throwaway.  Nicol at one point turns down Mark’s longings for a romantic relationship, which may call back to the death of her child, but if so, what a clumsy and half-baked reference for such a dark reveal.
		<br><br>
		A little past the halfway point in the movie, Mark finds the stomach to face his attackers in court (who look just as ridiculous as the Nicol’s ex-boyfriend), only to crawl and then run out of the courthouse when he is called upon to make a statement, triggered at the sight of them to hallucinate a scene where the chained convicts become their Nazi doll counterparts and begin to shoot apart the courtroom.  Nobody besides Mark’s lawyer seems to feel at all empathetic, or even uncomfortable as this all goes down.  The judge brazenly states that Hogancamp seems to not be in the right frame of mind and seemingly reprimands the lawyer for this, resetting the court date for later in the month and pounding the gavel.
		<br><br>
		Even the soundtrack gets whacky.  As Mark meticulously ties the hair of Nicol’s doll counterpart in a long ponytail, and slowed-down acoustic cover of “Yummy Yummy Yummy (I’ve Got Love in My Tummy)” inexplicably plays, making me wonder if someone in the sound department accidentally fat-fingered this song in place of another, and post-production was asleep at wheel.  Indeed, the post-production crew seemed to be absent in more than a few sectors of such an incomplete movie.
		<br><br>
		For Carell, his 2018 Holiday screen time continues, as he appears in Adam McKay’s <i>Vice</i>, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld alongside Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Sam Rockwell.  Despite Marwen, the 56-year-old only continues to ascend in his prominence as a legitimate Hollywood star.  Next up for Zemeckis is an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s <i>The Witches</i>, and <i>The King</i>, telling the story of King Kamehameha, the first leader to unite the islands of Hawaii, starring - who else? - Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.  Here’s to hoping that the esteemed director had a confounding misstep with <i>Marwen</i> and returns to form with material from one of the most beloved children’s authors of all time, and with a lead actor who, along with Carell, is vying one of the biggest names in the business.  As for <i>Marwen</i>, what a strange and befuddling welcome it was.

	      <h3>The Current Plight of Jim Boylen's Bulls</h3>

			<h5>6-minute read</h5>

			<h6>00:12 ET, 12.20.18</h6>

			<p>

			“We’ll be right back with a final word from the United Center.. after this timeout …”  71-year-old Chicago Bull play-by-play man Neil Funk’s voice aimlessly cascades into the abyss as a shroud of silence hovers over the arena.  Certainly the vast majority of the 18,000 fans who came out on a Tuesday night to watch their seven-win team take on the Brooklyn Nets - hours after the news that leading scorer Zach LaVine would be out 2-4 weeks with an ankle sprain - remained in the stands until the final buzzer.  
			<br><br>
			The despondency of supporter and announcer alike echoed full as the broadcast cut to commercial.  Just as happens with teams that have hit rock bottom - regardless of sport - the Bulls on this night found a way to lose.  Don’t get this confused with Chicago’s infamous early season losses to the Warriors, where Klay Thompson drained a league-record 14 treys, or to the 56-point trouncing by the Celtics.  Needless to say on these nights, the temperament of the team had doomed them before tip-off.  Not so tonight.
			<br><br>
			Funk’s broadcast partner Stacey King accurately noted that the loss tonight was not due to a lack of effort.  The young rotation of Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, and Wendell Carter Jr. among others put forth and inspired team performance throughout, holding an up-and-coming squad from Brooklyn below the century mark (this is the third time in four games the defense has achieved this, after accomplishing the feat a mere four times over their first 28 contests).
			<br><br>
			Perhaps (perhaps) coach Jim Boylen’s Thibodeau-like tactics are beginning to resonate among the roster a week and a half removed from the team’s near-insubordination of a practice the day after a back-to-back, the latter of which being the aforementioned Celtics debacle.  Though the Bulls have shown a defensive effort blatantly lacking earlier in the year, this cannot will shots to fall in the final minutes, nor can it even make for one teammate transferring the ball to another a sure thing.
			<br><br>
			Down one with the ball and the momentum, coming off a defensive forced shot clot violation and a full time out with 8.4 seconds left, Justin Holiday (in a role that likely would have been given to LaVine, if healthy) dances around the top of the key, not sure if he should shoot or pass, sees the clock tick below five seconds.  He sees Kris Dunn run towards him and hesitantly looks to hand off the ball into Dunn’s bread basket.  
			<br><br>
			The clumsiness of the almost-exchanged reaps consequences, as Spencer Dinwiddie - who he himself danced around until the shot clock went empty on the last possession - makes up for his indecision by grabbing away the ball from the two guards.  Boylen, stationary in bewilderment for a moment, claps his hands and encourage his players that the game is not over.  “Well, I am seeing effort,” he must console himself with. Out of the time out Bobby Portis saunters back onto the court, head shaking - unimpressed with coach’s message on the bench.  Free throws made, a last second heave down court, game over.
			<br><br>
			The Bulls would do well to look at the team they lost to and see themselves reflected.  Currently on pace for 18 wins this season, it was two seasons ago that the Nets finished 20-62, with young pups Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and Caris LaVert cutting their teeth in the NBA.  While still far from a threat in the East, Brooklyn now has that “hot young team” moniker attached to its aura.  
			<br><br>
			It was during that ‘16-’17 season that Kenny Atkinson took over the head coaching position.  Even with the 20-win season, Atkinson had almost universal approval from both the team and the media.  Not so with Boylen, a long-time NBA assistant and head coach at the University of Utah from 2007-’11.  After an appearance in the Big Dance in ‘09, his teams finished below .500 in his final two seasons at the then-Mountain West program before his firing.
			<br><br>
			After being Fred Hoiberg’s top assistant since his arrival in 2015, Boylen was name head coach on December 3rd, inheriting the 5-19 club without an interim tag.  After two weeks on the job with a last-place team, it is too early to pass judgment on Boylen and his demanding coaching style.  
			True are the following: the Bulls have young talent and cap space in the third largest market in the country.  But as for tonight, the team, and their coach, seem that they will be giving Neil Funk and their loyal fans many more desolate winter nights before the warmth of a winning franchise returns to the Windy City.
