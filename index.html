	    <h3>Something is off in <i>Marwen</i></h3>

	    <h5>11-minute read</h5>

	    <h6>14:13 ET, 12.21.18</h6>

	    <p>
	      
	      Unless a movie was particularly spectacular, after leaving a cinema usually my wife and I don’t discuss our thoughts on the movie we have just seen.  We will go out for dinner and discuss other parts of real life.  By the end of the evening, when our mental digestion of the film has begun to sink in, one of us will go back and comment on the film.  “There was something missing,” my wife said last night, simultaneously naturally and out of the blue.  She needn’t give context.
	      <br><br>
		The film <i>Welcome to Marwen</i> tells the real-life story of Mark Hogancamp, an artist who in April of 2000 was mercilessly beaten nearly to death by a group of five assailants outside of a bar after stating that he enjoyed wearing women’s shoes.  After coming out of a coma and suffering almost complete memory loss, Hogancamp deals with his PTSD by building a miniature town populated by a doll version of himself as a soldier for the Allied forces in World War II, along with the people he has come in contact with, including his attackers depicted in the form of Nazi soldiers.
		<br><br>
		It would be hard to blame Steve Carell for taking the part in Robert Zemeckis’ newest release, arriving alongside <i>Aquaman</i> and <i>Mary Poppins Returns</i>, all vying for holiday box office crowds.  Zemeckis has had a knack for finding a leading man and either jump-starting his career (as he did with Michael J. fox in the <i>Back to the Future</i> franchise), or further cementing him as an A+ list star (Tom Hanks in <i>Forrest Gump</i> and <i>Castaway</i>, Denzel Washington in <i>Flight</i>).  A big-name director, a moving true-life story of pain and perseverance, set for a Christmas release date.  The building blocks were there for Carrel to front the next successful installment of the Zemeckis canon.
		<br><br>
		As he has in films prior, Carell gives a performance to evidence that he is more than a master of comedy, possessing the chops to embody real-life figures struggling with various incarnations of darkness.  In 2014 his portrayal of wealthy, troubled Olympic wrestling sponsor John du Pont in Bennett Miller’s <i>Foxcatcher</i> earned him his first Oscar nomination.  His more recent performance as New York Times journalist David Sheff, dealing with a son (Timothee Chalamet) addicted to mathaphetamines garnered Carell, along with Chalamet, further critical acclaim in Felix van Groeningen’s <i>Beautiful Boy</i>.
		<br><br>
		In one of the several, semi-climactic apexes of <i>Marwen</i>, Carell’s eyes well up and spill over with tears as he realizes that to continue on with his life, he must face his real-life attackers.  I find crying scenes to be a good measure of an actor’s genuine abilities.  With some, you hear the voice break, see the face contort, but nary a tear falls.  With others, one or two will squeeze out as you see the actor behind the character grinding the mental wheels for the payoff.  Carell’s tears in this scene, were above all else, natural.  Have no doubt, this comedian is also a capital “A” actor.  Or to correct myself, he is an actor, who within his skill set happens to be an extraordinary comic.
		<br><br>
		Yet the environment, pacing, and overall writing of this movie simply seem off from beginning to end.  The technical achievement of filming nearly half the film in stop-motion animation, depicting Mark’s story being played out through the plastic eyes of Marwen’s dolls, is in and of itself visually striking.  Disappointingly for the actresses who surround and support Carell in the film, they are almost exclusively seen in their animated forms, acting literal props to help “Captain Hoagie” conquer his fears.
		<br><br>
		Many of these women also seem to be depicted as rigid figures of stereotypes.  Carell’s caregiver appears in all of one scene in her real-live human form, using a stunningly over-the-top Russian accent that was seemingly meant to be entertaining, but came off as simply unnecessary.  Another exhibit of this is Caralala, the Latina cook at the bar where Mark works (the same bar where he was beaten).  This bar is clearly not associated with any Latino themes, but in all of the two-and-a-half scenes in which Caralala appears, she wears traditional Latino blouses and skirts, so out of place as she and Mark prepare meatballs in a dingy upstate New York kitchen.  I won’t even go into explaining the French adult film actress who was somehow a necessary tertiary character and is portrayed by Zemeckis’ wife in real life.  In their doll forms, the woman are even more flamboyantly dressed in such outfits.  This is perhaps going for the “World Culture Barbie” feel, but the whole display simply left me thinking “Huh??”
		<br><br>
		The figure of Carell’s romantic interest is played by Leslie Mann, the seasoned veteran from a number of comedy films, many of which directed by her husband, Judd Apatow.  Mann also shows her talents as a sympathetic and caring figure, and her character, Nicol (“without the ‘e’”), admittedly does in many scenes where she is not an animated doll.  However, Zemeckis is intent on making her look as close to a doll as possible in these real-life scenes.  Her character has vivid red hair, wears brightly-colored dresses with flowery straps, loves having tea parties, and is occasionally stalked by a vaguely biker gang-like asshole of an ex-boyfriend.  I half expected Deadpool to drop in and cut this guy in half with his katanas and drop a one-liner.  Carell’s character also notices in one seen that Nicol at one time had a young son who had passed away.  This is never referenced again in the movie, almost echoing the scene from <i>The Room</i> where Lisa’s mother casually mentions that she has cancer as a one-line throwaway.  Nicol at one point turns down Mark’s longings for a romantic relationship, which may call back to the death of her child, but if so, what a clumsy and half-baked reference for such a dark reveal.
		<br><br>
		A little past the halfway point in the movie, Mark finds the stomach to face his attackers in court (who look just as ridiculous as the Nicol’s ex-boyfriend), only to crawl and then run out of the courthouse when he is called upon to make a statement, triggered at the sight of them to hallucinate a scene where the chained convicts become their Nazi doll counterparts and begin to shoot apart the courtroom.  Nobody besides Mark’s lawyer seems to feel at all empathetic, or even uncomfortable as this all goes down.  The judge brazenly states that Hogancamp seems to not be in the right frame of mind and seemingly reprimands the lawyer for this, resetting the court date for later in the month and pounding the gavel.
		<br><br>
		Even the soundtrack gets whacky.  As Mark meticulously ties the hair of Nicol’s doll counterpart in a long ponytail, and slowed-down acoustic cover of “Yummy Yummy Yummy (I’ve Got Love in My Tummy)” inexplicably plays, making me wonder if someone in the sound department accidentally fat-fingered this song in place of another, and post-production was asleep at wheel.  Indeed, the post-production crew seemed to be absent in more than a few sectors of such an incomplete movie.
		<br><br>
		For Carell, his 2018 Holiday screen time continues, as he appears in Adam McKay’s <i>Vice</i>, as Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld alongside Christian Bale, Amy Adams, and Sam Rockwell.  Despite Marwen, the 56-year-old only continues to ascend in his prominence as a legitimate Hollywood star.  Next up for Zemeckis is an adaptation of Roald Dahl’s <i>The Witches</i>, and <i>The King</i>, telling the story of King Kamehameha, the first leader to unite the islands of Hawaii, starring - who else? - Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson.  Here’s to hoping that the esteemed director had a confounding misstep with <i>Marwen</i> and returns to form with material from one of the most beloved children’s authors of all time, and with a lead actor who, along with Carell, is vying one of the biggest names in the business.  As for <i>Marwen</i>, what a strange and befuddling welcome it was.

	      <h3>The Current Plight of Jim Boylen's Bulls</h3>

			<h5>6-minute read</h5>

			<h6>00:12 ET, 12.20.18</h6>

			<p>

			“We’ll be right back with a final word from the United Center.. after this timeout …”  71-year-old Chicago Bull play-by-play man Neil Funk’s voice aimlessly cascades into the abyss as a shroud of silence hovers over the arena.  Certainly the vast majority of the 18,000 fans who came out on a Tuesday night to watch their seven-win team take on the Brooklyn Nets - hours after the news that leading scorer Zach LaVine would be out 2-4 weeks with an ankle sprain - remained in the stands until the final buzzer.  
			<br><br>
			The despondency of supporter and announcer alike echoed full as the broadcast cut to commercial.  Just as happens with teams that have hit rock bottom - regardless of sport - the Bulls on this night found a way to lose.  Don’t get this confused with Chicago’s infamous early season losses to the Warriors, where Klay Thompson drained a league-record 14 treys, or to the 56-point trouncing by the Celtics.  Needless to say on these nights, the temperament of the team had doomed them before tip-off.  Not so tonight.
			<br><br>
			Funk’s broadcast partner Stacey King accurately noted that the loss tonight was not due to a lack of effort.  The young rotation of Lauri Markkanen, Kris Dunn, and Wendell Carter Jr. among others put forth and inspired team performance throughout, holding an up-and-coming squad from Brooklyn below the century mark (this is the third time in four games the defense has achieved this, after accomplishing the feat a mere four times over their first 28 contests).
			<br><br>
			Perhaps (perhaps) coach Jim Boylen’s Thibodeau-like tactics are beginning to resonate among the roster a week and a half removed from the team’s near-insubordination of a practice the day after a back-to-back, the latter of which being the aforementioned Celtics debacle.  Though the Bulls have shown a defensive effort blatantly lacking earlier in the year, this cannot will shots to fall in the final minutes, nor can it even make for one teammate transferring the ball to another a sure thing.
			<br><br>
			Down one with the ball and the momentum, coming off a defensive forced shot clot violation and a full time out with 8.4 seconds left, Justin Holiday (in a role that likely would have been given to LaVine, if healthy) dances around the top of the key, not sure if he should shoot or pass, sees the clock tick below five seconds.  He sees Kris Dunn run towards him and hesitantly looks to hand off the ball into Dunn’s bread basket.  
			<br><br>
			The clumsiness of the almost-exchanged reaps consequences, as Spencer Dinwiddie - who he himself danced around until the shot clock went empty on the last possession - makes up for his indecision by grabbing away the ball from the two guards.  Boylen, stationary in bewilderment for a moment, claps his hands and encourage his players that the game is not over.  “Well, I am seeing effort,” he must console himself with. Out of the time out Bobby Portis saunters back onto the court, head shaking - unimpressed with coach’s message on the bench.  Free throws made, a last second heave down court, game over.
			<br><br>
			The Bulls would do well to look at the team they lost to and see themselves reflected.  Currently on pace for 18 wins this season, it was two seasons ago that the Nets finished 20-62, with young pups Dinwiddie, Joe Harris, and Caris LaVert cutting their teeth in the NBA.  While still far from a threat in the East, Brooklyn now has that “hot young team” moniker attached to its aura.  
			<br><br>
			It was during that ‘16-’17 season that Kenny Atkinson took over the head coaching position.  Even with the 20-win season, Atkinson had almost universal approval from both the team and the media.  Not so with Boylen, a long-time NBA assistant and head coach at the University of Utah from 2007-’11.  After an appearance in the Big Dance in ‘09, his teams finished below .500 in his final two seasons at the then-Mountain West program before his firing.
			<br><br>
			After being Fred Hoiberg’s top assistant since his arrival in 2015, Boylen was name head coach on December 3rd, inheriting the 5-19 club without an interim tag.  After two weeks on the job with a last-place team, it is too early to pass judgment on Boylen and his demanding coaching style.  
			True are the following: the Bulls have young talent and cap space in the third largest market in the country.  But as for tonight, the team, and their coach, seem that they will be giving Neil Funk and their loyal fans many more desolate winter nights before the warmth of a winning franchise returns to the Windy City.
